To change the rendered images you need to override the default images and settings. Please do not change the files in the root folder of the app, but only in the mods folder.

If any reuqired file is not found in the mod folder, the default file will be used.

Each mod must contain a description.json file in the root folder of the mod. It must contain the name of the mod and the author, as well as the version in the format "x.x" (only in this format).

A mod may contain a small picture called 'preview.png' to roughly show what the mod does.

To distribute the mod it can be packed in a zip-archive (without the root folder mod, the archive should contains immediately folders overridden by the mod), and then placed in the folder 'mods/' of the app. At the next launch the mod will be automatically unpacked and displayed in the list of mods.
